    <p>Pong is one of the first computer games ever created. This simple "tennis-like" game features two paddles and a ball, and the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first to reach 10 points; a player scores a point whenever the opponent misses the ball. The game can be played by two human players or one player against a computer-controlled paddle. It was originally developed by Allan Alcorn and released in 1972 by Atari.</p>
